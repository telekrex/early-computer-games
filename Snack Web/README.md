The name, I don't know. I have no idea why it's called Snack Web. GameMaker had a web browser window feature, which I found then, and still find now, surprising. So I attempted to use that to create a custom web browser. Of course later in life I understand software more, and know that this is silly, but back then I was just having fun with it. When you open this, it doesn't open to a web browser really, but a Home Screen. Probably inspired by modern gaming consoles. Funny, because even today I think about how interesting of a challenge it would be to develop a web browser, but I don't think I have the time.
