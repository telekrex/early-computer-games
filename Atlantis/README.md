Okay, there's only one reason I've included this in the collection - the demonstration of an improving UI designer and nostalgic usage of PlayStation sounds, lol. When you open this, it's just a menu screen for something I don't remember designing, and it appears to not be a game. The only thing you can do here is listen to a radio recording from a NASA space mission. No idea where this was headed, but obivously it didn't get far.
