Before Skyfear was a real game, I'd pretended it was, and made this. The original ideas for Skyfear were all over the place, having not just dragons but futuristic soldiers, tanks, and fighter jets. I was heavily influenced by a movie called Dragon Wars, and the Killzone first person shooter franchise. My ideas were so much more grandios than what they are now, but that would never be achievable at my scale. After I discovered Lair for Playstation3, I fell more in love with the idea of projectile battles and thought about the game being more like Halo 3's multiplayer, and the design started changing, but the ball also got rolling.

However none of that stopped me from making a scrolling shooter inspired by my earlier work on Blood and Talons. I made an "arcade" version of Skyfear and I think when you play it, it gives you a window into that cacophony of ideas. I intended to release this with Skyfear (at the time, in 2012), not really knowing that the game would never be released until it would be entirely reborn and take 7+ years to make. Oh, also, I used a Skrillex song on the main menu, so "created in 2012" is undeniable.
