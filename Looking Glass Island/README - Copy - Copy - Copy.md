# Looking Glass Island


I have extremely fond memories of working on this, but sadly ..

Project Hero Pre-Alpha 0.1 - Probably the earliest build
HERO 0.2 - A progression from 0.1
Protoria Never 0.0.0.1 - A very chaotic deviation into more of an action RPG? It appears I added lightsaber combat, a leveling system (where it plays a dubstep remix of skrille ruffneck mixed with Patrick Star's yelling on level up), and village murderering.

Looking Glass Island 0.2 - This one appears a lot more like a game with a direction to it, it has a HUD, a title screen, saving and loading (although idk if that works). However it seems like a lot of things seen in previous builds either got axed or I attempted to remake or improve but did not finish, so in some ways it's a downgrade even though it's the most recent version.
