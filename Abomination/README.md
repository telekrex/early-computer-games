This was two games I made where I had a temporary obsession with making top-down shooters in GameMaker. I think it's about a yeti that... has a gun? And was supposed to be a wave defense / zombie kind of game. It's strange because between the two games, there's some things that were improved the second time but other things that were downgrades. I wish I could remember how long I spent on these, probably not long. I can't stand to play them for more than a few minutes, but that's because I lacked a lot of knowledge on gamefeel, controls, sensitivity, etc. These games are significant however because I remember this being roughly the starting point of where I wanted to get serious about game development. Soon after these games, I attempted to remake/reboot them in Blender, but that was quickly abandoned for "Aliens".
