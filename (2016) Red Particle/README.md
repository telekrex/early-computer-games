I'm not sure what this was supposed to be, but I've opened it several times over the years and enjoyed looking at it. It's not really a game - although perhaps it was inspired by Pyro Sand, a game I played a lot as a kid. Basically it's just an empty black screen, and wherever you click with the left mouse button, a pixel will light up red. The pixel will 'radiate' and light other pixels around it, and together they will sort of 'flicker'. I don't remember if the radiating is random or if there's a pattern to it, but the results are kind of mesmerizing.

For some reason this .exe originally had the name Lepidoptera, which I later used in a horror game (an extension, actually of Axiom, in this same collection). However I remember mentally referring to it as "Red Particle", so I've renamed the .exe.
