I was obsessed with the idea of creating a simulated operating system. I still am today, but I'm smarter about scoping things now and I know going to the depth that I want would be too time consuming for the results. This was a cool experiment though - you can even really tell between the versions there was some real progression of ideas. I really went an artsy route with this, trying to imagine what a reinvention of the modern operating system would look like. I'm trying to remember what my main influences were on this. Possibly Apple, but if they were extremely minimal, almost esoteric. PlayStation2 is probably closer.
