I can't be certain, but I think this was one of the very first games I ever made. A "wombo" was a strange little creature my friends and I had made up - or maybe it was just me, I don't remember - and for some reason the desire was to brutally murder them. I was probably in middle school, and extremely influenced by Call of Duty: Black Ops and meme culture at the time. Nyan cat and bunchie were all over my hard drive, really it was such a mess looking back into there. Wombo Hunter takes on the basic format of Duck Hunt, a wave shooter, and was made in GameMaker, I think GameMaker 5. It's set to a very low frame rate for some reason, and such a stupid game, but oddly it's one of my favorites to actually sit and play with.
