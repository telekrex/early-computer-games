This one's pretty weird. All I remember about this was that I wanted to make a multiplayer game, another top-down shooter. With an aesthetic extremely influenced by TRON: Legacy, apparently. As far as I know, this multiplayer attempt never worked, I can't get it to work. But since I remember nothing about it, I'm not sure if I'm missing something.

### Controls
WASD to move, mouse to aim, left click to shoot
