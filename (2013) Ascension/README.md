Stunningly, this project is one of the most playable and seem-to-have-a-direction, yet I don't remember anything about making it. Just that it was a really intense 2 or 3 days of putting it together, and I really liked the art direction. Still do. This was going to be a pretty scary horror game about being on a different planet. I think the idea was like A Wrinkle in Time meets Prometheus (that movie had released less than six months prior to the build date here). I wish I would've went further with this one.
